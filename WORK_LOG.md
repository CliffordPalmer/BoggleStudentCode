| April 5      |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| January 8th  | 11:25-11:55am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Was sick the day the problem was announced. Currently using a recursive DFS function to search for words. The theory itself is pretty simple, but I have a few bugs right now. |
| January 10th |  9:25-9:55am  |                                                                                                                                                                     My DFS function is working! I pass all the checks in correctness, but some take too long. Right now, to deal with duplicate words, I just do a pass through the goodWords, and remove duplicates, which is definitely taking a lot of time. |
| January 12th | 10:00-10:30pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                         Instead of passing through the list of goodWords at the end, I'm not storing the found words in a trie, which I search every time I find a new word to avoid duplicates. This cuts down the time a lot. |
| January 12th | 10:30-11:00pm |  To speed things up even more, I'm no longer using a tst to store found words, and instead have a boolean in the TSTNode class itself which stores whether the word has been added. This speeds things up, as I don't have to search at all to deal with duplicates. It took a little fiddling around, but now my TST returns TSTNodes instead of booleans when searching, allowing me to access that variable. |
